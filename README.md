I started by creating the HTML part fully where i implemented the IDs and names that im going to use later and min/max validations for every input. The inputs i gathered
in a form tag and for the Car Type and Lease Period i used a combination of label and select tags. Next i developed the CSS file where i specified
the font, padding, border, max width and shadow for the calculator container also made a 2 column grid for the form. I have made a responsive design with
3 specified media queries where the font size and padding decrease on smaller devices and the form transforms into a single column. At least i finished with the JavaScript file
with the calculations and validation of the inputs. First, I made a function to keep text inputs and range inputs synced then some validation and at least theÂ 
calculation agreed with the Business Rules.
